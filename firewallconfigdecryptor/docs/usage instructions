Parsing firewall configurations:
----------------------------

to parse one or more Cisco PIX/IOS/ASA configuration text files located in a folder:

$ firewallconfigurationdecryptor --config "<full-path-to-configuration-folder>"


Parser output:
--------------

The output generated is stored in a "parser_output" folder created at the same-level as the configuration file input folder. This folder has the following tree structure:

// service flow views (graphml format)
service_explicit
  tcp
    host
    zone
       service_tcp_http.graphml
       <other tcp services encountered.graphml>
       service_tcp_http.pdf
       <other tcp services encountered.pdf>
  udp
  icmp
  eigrp
  ip
  <other ip protocols found>
service_implicit
service_final
// zone-firewall models (graphml format)
zone_fw_start.graphml
zone_fw_interim.graphml
zone_fw_final.graphml
// zone-conduit model (graphml format)
zone_conduit.graphml
// zone breakdowns (graphml format)
<zoneX.graphml>
// zone-firewall models (pdf format)
zone_fw_start.pdf
zone_fw_interim.pdf
zone_fw_final.pdf
// zone-conduit model (pdf format)
zone_conduit.pdf
// zone breakdowns (pdf format)
<zone breakdown for each zone - zoneX.pdf>

To view any of the .graphml files:
--------------------

1. open yED Graph Editor application
2. select 'open' and pick the particular .graphml file
3. by default, graph properties are not automatically mapped to their label text. from the yED menu, select Edit->Properties Mapper
4. If the mapping table (with column headings: Data Source, Map To, Conversion) is empty:
      select the + sign on the right of the table - this will add a default mapping of label->Label Text
5. If the mapping exists, select 'New Configuration (Node)' from the list of configuration on the left. Then select 'Apply'
   Similarly select 'New Configuration (Edge)' and select 'Apply'
   Then select 'Ok'
6. From the yED menu select Layout->Circular, keep the default settings and choose 'Ok'
7. You should now be able to view the graph layout with node and edge properties populated. To view Node and Edge properties select the particular Node/Edge and scroll
   to the 'Data' section under the 'Properties View' panel that appears to your right.

P.S: make sure to SAVE the file once you follow the above steps, so next time when you open it, you wont have to redo them.
     yEd only supports directed graphs, so the direction should be ignored for zone-firewall and zone-conduit models as they are un-directed.
     however, the service-flows are directed graphs and are shown correctly when opened.

Known limitations
-----------

Only parses a single Cisco ASA configuration file at a time. Does not synthesise output from individual firewall configuration files.
Zone breakdowns are not created for unknown zones attached to gateways found through route processing. This is simply because we did not
have access to actual gateway configurations at the time and could not precisely state the composition of these zones.

Currently the tool supports IPV4 configurations only.
